        <h2>The History of Rose</h2>
        <p>
          Roses are among the oldest cultivated flowers in human history.
          Archaeological evidence shows that roses have existed for over *35
          million years*. They were first grown in gardens nearly *5,000 years
          ago* in China.

          In Ancient Rome, roses were used in celebrations and also as a symbol
          of luxury. Today, the rose is called the **“Queen of Flowers”**,
          symbolizing love, passion, and beauty worldwide. Different colors
          carry different meanings:
